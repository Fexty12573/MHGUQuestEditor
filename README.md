## Recommended Usage
I suggest first setting a path to a quest list in the settings and enabling the auto-update feature. Then you can start editing quests by opening a quest arc (`qXXXXXXX.arc`).

## Unsupported Files
For files that are currently unsupported, you can edit them using a hex editor. If you're using 010 Editor you can find templates for many of the files [here](https://github.com/RTHKKona/MHGUModding/tree/main/templates).
